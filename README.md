# Snowman

Console mode implementation of the popular game: Hangman.

Snowman is a word guessing game, played with two players (the user and the computer). The user first selects a category: 
Sports, Movies, or Geography (countries). The computer randomly selects a word then the user attempts to guess the word by suggesting letters that the word may include.
If the user guesses the word within 10 tries (before the snowman is completed visible), the user wins. Word separation is expressed as "_" that is visible 
in case there are multiple words to be guessed.
