# Snowman

Console mode implementation of the popular game Snowman.

Snowman is a word guessing game, played with two players (the user and the computer). The computer randomly 
selects a word then the user attempts to guess the word by suggesting letters that the word may include.
If the user guesses the word within 10 tries (before the snowman is completed visible), the user wins.
